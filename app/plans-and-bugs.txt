PLANS:
- make designing easier and more user friendly. (add/remove divs, images, tables, textbox's, etc:)
 - clean code (all mirroring) that has synaptic meaning.
  - when textbox is checked/input disabled remove mirroring css from code.
  - show elements/element groups within groups (act like photoshop layers. name will be class names and/or elements | This can be accomplished using Codemirror)
- fix for touch support
- add global class styles support for additional design customization
- add snap to grid option
- add box-shadow & text-shadow options (add the ability to add multiple shadows)
- add background gradient option with hsl(a) color picker

BUGS:
- edit tool becomes inactive once select tool is active. THIS HAS TO BE FIXED!
