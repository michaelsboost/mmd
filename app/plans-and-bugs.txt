PLANS:
- Make designing easier and more user friendly. (Add/Remove divs, images, tables, textbox's, etc:)
 - Clean code (all mirroring) that has synaptic meaning.
  - When textbox is checked/input disabled remove mirroring css from code.
  - Show elements & element groups within library. (This can be accomplished using the Codemirror JS Library)
  
BUGS:
 - All textboxes within select should be disabled when onload.
