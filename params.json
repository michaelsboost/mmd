{"name":"My Mobile Design","tagline":"A WYSIWYG Website Designer","body":"### DESIGNING THE MODERN WEB\r\nThere's many great tools out there for web design like [Adobe Edge Animate](http://html.adobe.com/edge/animate/), [Google Web Designer](https://www.google.com/webdesigner/), and [Adobe Proto](http://www.freenew.net/android/adobe-proto/10004112.htm) (Except discontinued for android), but these tools are only good for those users who are running Windows, Mac OS X, or the iOS platforms. I however couldn't find a decent website designer for Linux or Android so I decided to make my own for [Linux](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mmd/files/mmd-linux.tar.gz/download), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.michael.mmdesign), and [Online](http://mmd.sourceforge.net/app/) as a fun experiment.\r\n\r\nYou can try the minimulistic version on [Codepen](http://codepen.io/mikethedj4/pen/gCsih)\r\n\r\n### FEATURES\r\n\r\n* [WYSIWYG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wysiwyg) Styled Editing\r\n* Responsive & Interactive Design\r\n* Available For: [Linux](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mmd/files/mmd-linux.tar.gz/download)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.michael.mmdesign)/[Online](http://mmd.sourceforge.net/app/)\r\n* MMD encourages class based syntaxes\r\n* Pseudo class selectors via Global Styles\r\n* Integrated Media Queries for Responsive Design.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
